# NLP-SPAM
SMS Spam Detection using Natual Language Processing and ScikitLearn

Natural Language Processing is a well-known method to make the computers able to understand human langugaes as it is written and spoken. NLP allows one to do manipulation of such data so tha artificial intelligence comes into play. 
A combination of NLP and Machine Learning Classifiers has great ability to reduce reduandant work which involves humans.
In this programme I have tried to use NLP and different kind of classifiers to predict whether a SMS/Email received is a 'ham/spam'. 
Different classification models used are -
  1. Naive Bias - Multinomial
  2. Random Forest Classifier
  3. KNN Clustering Algorithms

Classification Reports for different models has been generated to compare so that best can be used.
